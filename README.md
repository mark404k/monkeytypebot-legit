Monkeytype  Robot. Version 0.1

How to work with it?

If you need to change wpm, change the WPM = x in the code

I have bot detected. What i need to do to fix that?

1. Decrease or increase randint in delay 
2. Decrease WPM
3. You can make misspeled word using backspace.

I dont have a 110 or 200 wpm, but value of WPM = 110/200. What i do wrong?

Nothing. Script decrase some wpm to make test look more legit

Why chrome opened but script does not do anything?

I maded a time.sleep(30) to give you time to log into your account
you can disable it by just changing value of sleep, etc time.sleep(1).
